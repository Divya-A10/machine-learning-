## Stock Data Extraction and Visualization

This project demonstrates how to extract historical stock and revenue data using yfinance and web scraping techniques, and visualize them using Plotly. It covers stock data for companies like Tesla and GameStop.

Features

Extract historical stock price data using the yfinance library
Web scrape quarterly revenue data from financial webpages using requests and BeautifulSoup
Clean and preprocess financial data (removing commas, dollar signs, converting dates)
Visualize stock prices and revenue over time with interactive Plotly graphs
Support for multiple stocks: Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME)
Getting Started

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Packages: pandas, yfinance, requests, beautifulsoup4, plotly
Install the required libraries with:

pip install pandas yfinance requests beautifulsoup4 plotly
How to Run
Use yfinance to download stock data:
import yfinance as yf
tesla = yf.Ticker("TSLA")
tesla_data = tesla.history(period="max")
tesla_data.reset_index(inplace=True)
Use requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape quarterly revenue data from webpages.
Clean and preprocess the revenue data (remove $, ,, convert to datetime).
Use the provided make_graph function to plot the stock price and revenue data:
make_graph(tesla_data, tesla_revenue, 'Tesla')
make_graph(gme_data, gme_revenue, 'GameStop')
